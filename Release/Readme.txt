This mod makes the wires and bearings easier to see. It adds a dark contour on wires, bearings and connections to make them more visible. 
HOW TO INSTALL:
Goto:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\387990\2623326387"
copy the Data folder into:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Scrap Mechanic"
and replace the exsiting files.


HOW TO UNINSTALL:
The easier way is to use the steam tool to "Verify integrity of game files"

If you want to restore the original files manually, go to:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\387990\2623326387\Backup"
copy the Data folder into:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Scrap Mechanic"
(replacing the exsisting files).


HOW TO INSTALL SMALL BEARINGS
 After the normal installation, go to:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Scrap Mechanic\Data\Mesh"
Rename the file "bearing_connect.mesh" to something else like "bearing_connect_standard.mesh"
Rename the file "bearing_connect_small.mesh" to "bearing_connect.mesh"
(if you don't see the ".mesh" at the end of the name, just ignore that part).

HOW TO MOD UNCONNECTED BEARINGS
This feature is experimental, the unconnected bearing uses a "generic" texture that could be used by other things. I could not find any broken texture with this mod applied, if you do please let me know!
To install, copy transparent.tga from the folder:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\387990\2623326387\NotConnectedBearing"
and paste it in:
"...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Scrap Mechanic\Data\Texture"
