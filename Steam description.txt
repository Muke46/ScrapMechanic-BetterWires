[h1]  Compatible with the 0.6.0 test version [/h1]

This mod makes the wires and bearings easier to see. It adds a dark contour on wires, bearings and connection points to make them more visible. 

Work with the right folder depending on your game version (0.5 or 0.6 test)
For the test version remember to go to: "...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Scrap Mechanic\Cache" and delete Texture and Mesh folders before starting the game, otherwise you will see no changes
